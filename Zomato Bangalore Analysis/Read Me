ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest Power BI Project ðŸš€
Today marks a significant milestone as I successfully crafted my third dashboard, dedicated to @Zomato Bangalore Analysis, utilizing the powerful capabilities of Power BI Desktop. 
The process involved several key steps:
1.	Data Gathering: I connected the database with Power BI Desktop using CSV files, and the data source was obtained from @Kaggle, providing a rich and comprehensive dataset to work with.
2.	Data Cleaning: With the power of Power Query Editor, I efficiently cleaned the data, ensuring accuracy and consistency for the subsequent analyses.
3.	Table and Relationship Analysis: I dived deep into the data to identify patterns, trends, and insights by meticulously analysing the tables and establishing relationships between them to form a robust data model.
4.	Dashboard Creation: The culmination of this project was the creation of an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard that presents the key findings and visualizations in a clear and concise manner.
